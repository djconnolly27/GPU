									<p>When people normally think of the path a light travels, one would start from the light
									source with a light ray. The light ray would proceed to run into an object and reflect
									off the surface. Finally, those light rays would end up in your eyes and allow you to perceive
									light the way you do. However, this is not the process that takes place in the computer
									graphics world. Even with a single point as the light source, the light rays from the single
									point would go out in every direction inside the virtual 3D space. Some of them may be heading
									in a direction of no return while others would be simply blocked by objects in the way. In
									neither of the cases would the light enter your eye. As those light rays become irrelevant how
									you perceive the world, the elimination of such rays would significantly reduce the amount of
									computation done. The way to know whether we care about a light ray, not surprisingly, begins
									its journey at “the eye”, or the viewing point inside the virtual 3D space. As the ray cast
									into the model space gets reflected off of a surface and finally reach a light source, the
									patch of object surface would then computationally rendered with the added effects of light.</p>
									<p>Ray tracing provides a lot of benefits over traditional raster graphics.</p>
									<h2>Ray-triangle Intersection Test</h2>
									<p>As mentioned in the raster graphics, triangles made up one of the most important primitives
									that are used to construct a 3D object thanks to its low-cost long-term storage and versatile
									geometric property. A ray cast onto a triangle based 3D model is bound to hit one of the triangles.
									Determining the exact triangle that insects with the light ray is thus an unavoidable task in the ray
									tracing world.</p>
									<p>From barycentric coordinate system, we know that a point, given triangle $\mathbf{ABC}$, can be expressed as</p>
									<center><p>$\mathbf{p}(\gamma, \beta) = \gamma(\mathbf{c}-\mathbf{a})+\beta(\mathbf{b}-\mathbf{a})+\mathbf{a}$</p></center>
									<p>At the same time, the light ray we cast from a viewing point $\mathbf{e}$ through a pixel point $\mathbf{s}$ is given by</p>
									<center><p>$\mathbf{r}=\mathbf{e}+\mathbf{d}t$</p></center>
									<center><p>$with \mathbf{d} = \mathbf{s}-\mathbf{e}$</p></center>
									<p>We can find if there is an intersection between the plane of the triangle and the light ray and where by equating the two equations
									and solve for $\beta, \gamma$, and $t$</p>
									<center><p>$\mathbf{e}+\mathbf{d}t = \gamma(\mathbf{c}-\mathbf{a})+\beta(\mathbf{b}-\mathbf{a})+\mathbf{a}$</p></center>
									<p>The vector equation can be broken up as three equations</p>
									<center><p>$x_e+x_dt = x_a+\beta(x_b-x_a)+\gamma(x_c-x_a)$</p></center>
									<center><p>$y_e+y_dt = y_a+\beta(y_b-y_a)+\gamma(y_c-y_a)$</p></center>
									<center><p>$z_e+z_dt = z_a+\beta(z_b-z_a)+\gamma(z_c-z_a)$</p></center>
									<p>which can rewritten in matrix form as the following </p>
									<center><p>$matrix form$</p></center>
									<p>With Cramer’s rule, we know that for an matrix multiplication $\mathbf{A}\vec{x}=\vec{b}$ assuming $\mathbf{A}$ invertible,
									the solution to $x_i$, which is the ith entry of the unknown vector, is given by</p>
									<center><p>$x_i = \frac{det[\mathbf{A_i}]}{det[\mathbf{A}]}$</p></center>
									<p>where $\mathbf{A_i}$ stands for the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ with ith column replaced with $\vec{b}$.</p>
									<center><p>$\beta = \frac{\begin{vmatrix}x_e-x_a &x_c-x_a &-x_d\\y_e-y_a &y_c-y_a &-y_d\\z_e-z_a &z_c-z_a &-z_d\end{vmatrix}}{\begin{vmatrix}A\end{vmatrix}}$</p></center>
									<center><p>$\gamma= \frac{\begin{vmatrix}x_b-x_a &x_e-x_a &-x_d\\y_b-y_a &y_e-y_a &-y_d\\z_b-z_a &z_e-z_a &-z_d\end{vmatrix}}{\begin{vmatrix}A\end{vmatrix}}$</p></center>
									<center><p>$\gamma= \frac{\begin{vmatrix}x_b-x_a &x_c-x_a &x_e-x_a\\y_b-y_a &y_c-y_a &y_e-y_a\\z_b-z_a &z_c-z_a &y_e-y_a\end{vmatrix}}{\begin{vmatrix}A\end{vmatrix}}$</p></center>
									<p>Nonetheless, for he given point of intersection to sit within the triangle, we would need the solutions to abide by the following</p>
									<center><p>$\gamma + \beta < 1$</p></center>
									<center><p>$\gamma > 0$</p></center>
									<center><p>$\beta > 0$</p></center>
									<center><p>$t_{min} < t < t_{max}$</p></center>
									<p>t_{min} and t_{max} specify the block region within which the triangles are located. Such regions is discussed in the next section </p>
									<h2>Bounding Box</h2>
									<p>Ray-triangle intersection tests become expensive as a direct test would require checking every single triangle to determine the relevant
										triangles. The size of the problem grows linearly with the number of triangles within a 3D scene and quickly become not manageable.
										Various techniques can be employed to achieve sublinear performance. “Divide and conquer” with bounding boxes is one of the efficient ways to achieve the performance. We first take a look at 2D bounding box.</p>
									<center><img src="images!!" alt="Insert pic" /></center>
									<p>For a 2D bounding box, its four edges can be represented as</p>
									<center><p>$x = x_{min}$</p></center>
									<center><p>$x = x_{max}$</p></center>
									<center><p>$y = y_{min}$</p></center>
									<center><p>$y = y_{max}$</p></center>
									<p>As a light ray is parameterized as $f=x_e+tx_d$, finding the t at which the light ray intersects with a given ray is </p>
									<center><p>$t_{xmin} = \frac{x_{min}-x_e}{x_d}$</p></center>
									<center><p>$t_{xmax} = \frac{x_{max}-x_e}{x_d}$</p></center>
									<center><p>$t_{ymin} = \frac{y_{min}-y_e}{y_d}$</p></center>
									<center><p>$t_{ymax} = \frac{y_{max}-y_e}{y_d}}$</p></center>
									<p>The only way for the light ray to intersect a box is to fulfill the following condition</p>
									<center><p>$[t_{xmin}, t_{xmax}]\cup[t_{ymin}, t_{ymax}] \ne \emptyset$</p></center>
									<p>The pseudo code for the bounding box intersection test is:</p>
									<p>Which makes sense as if the minimum of one is larger than the maximum of the other there will not be any intersection.
									The following picture also illustrate this principle well.</p>
									<center><img src="images!!" alt="Insert pic 9.16" /></center>
									<p>The bounding box in 3D easily extend the same principle into a higher dimension.</p>
									<center><p>$[t_{xmin}, t_{xmax}]\cup[t_{ymin}, t_{ymax}] \cup[t_{zmin}, t_{zmax}]\ne \emptyset$</p></center>
									<h2>Bounding Volume Hierarchy</h2>
									<p>In order to effectively implement this method of looking at bounding boxes, we can create a structure known as a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH). A BVH is a tree structure that contains subtrees and, at its lowest levels,
										a set of basic primitives such as triangles. This structure exploits coherence in a scene in order to break the primitives of a scene into groups. These groups, for example, might contain the entire scene at the highest level, similar
									objects at the next level, a singular object at the next, and primitives at the last. The BVH we will utilize relies on an object hierarchy, which is more robust over time than a spatial hierarchy in dynamic scenes. It also contributes to better hardware performance, as
								it can reject bounding volumes irrelevant to a given ray extremely quickly.</p>

								<p>
									It is important to consider the shape of the bounding volumes as well. To simplify and reduce the number of calculations, loosely constrained bounding volumes may seem the best option, but many rays that hit these volumes will still miss the object or primitive within them. In contrast,
									if the bounding volume for an object is simply that object, we will waste fewer calculations but need to perform more calculations overall. As a result, we generally select volumes somewhere between these two extremes, such as parallelopipeds or spheres.
								</p>

								<center><img src="images/bvh.png" alt="A Bounding Volume Hierarchy example" /></center>

								<p>When optimizing a BVH, the intersection point of a ray with a bounding volume is actually irrelevant. Instead, all we care about is whether or not the ray intersects the volume. It then becomes important to search and store the BVH in an efficient manner.
									In this vein, ray casting algorithms tend to perform a depth-first traversal of the BVH. Moreover, one efficient approach to storing a BVH is to maintain a tree where each node contains a reference to the left-most child, the right sibling, and the parent node. This organization allows us to store a skip node, which contains the node to which
									we redirect our search if we arrive at a leaf or miss a bounding volume. This ensures better memory usage; though more information is stored in the tree, the nodes are stored in the order they are accessed in, providing memory coherence. [Smits 1999] Another way to improve memory performance is to cache the most recently hit object and check that object and
									the surrounding scene first with the next rays, as they will likely be directed in quite similar directions to the last ray.
								</p>

								<p>
									Ray packets are another technique for optimizing the process of ray tracing. By combining similar rays into packets, we can again take advantage of the parallelism existing within GPUs and specifically the SIMD architecture. To minimize the hardware necessary to construct these packets, we utilize ray packet sizes that are powers of two.
									Additionally, we may approach the problem of computing ray-box overlap from the perspective of Kay and Kajiya's slabs algorithm. This algorithm essentially relies on breaking bounding volumes up into sets of planes, or slabs. These slabs are the space between two planes, such that the one plane is $d_{near}$ units from the origin and one is
									 $d_{far}$ units from the origin, with the planes being defined by a vector normal to each surface of the bounding volume, the volume itself an intersection of bounding slabs. We then compute the intersection of a ray with a slab by computing its intersection with both slabs to compute an interval for the intersection. If we then compute the insection of the
									 intervals, we can compute the intersection of the ray with a bounding volume. Many solutions to the problem of ray-axis-aligned-bounding-box intersection tests are variants on this slab test.

							<p>
									 The SIMD structure also allows for the testing of four rays against each box and primitive simultaneously. This proves especially useful if we are testing multiple identical rays, perhaps to acheive greater accuracy and eliminate
									the need for denoising, although it also proves useful when testing with multiple rays that are similar but not identical as well. For reference, the new real-time ray tracing hardware available today tends to rely on one to two rays per pixel as well as denoising to produce photorealistic images.
