# Computer Architecture Final Project: GPU Design and Research
### By Daniel Connolly and Qingmu "Josh" Deng

In our final project for our computer architecture course, we intend to design and implement in Verilog some of the circuitry that handles vector operations within the Graphics Processing Unit of a computer and to explore, on a more broad scale, the architecture of GPUs.
