# Computer Architecture Final Project: GPU Design and Research
### By Daniel Connolly and Qingmu "Josh" Deng

## Proposal
### Project Overview
In our final project for our computer architecture course, we intend to design and implement in Verilog some of the circuitry that handles vector operations within the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) of a computer and to explore, on a more broad scale, the architecture of GPUs. We hope this will lead us to a deeper understanding of the component and how it interacts with other elements of computers. We will begin by

In order to develop an understanding of graphics processing units, we will investigate the following resources:

### Deliverables
In terms of deliverables, we will produce a report demonstrating our level of GPU architecture understanding and explaining the purpose and functionality of this architecture. Additionally, we will produce a Verilog codebase that demonstrates the process by which GPUs perform vector calculations based upon our own design, which will be further elucidated in our report.
##### Minimum
Our minimum deliverable will be a report demonstrating the research we have performed over the course of the project and what we have learned from the process. It will describe how GPUs work on a high level as well as providing more detail about individual parts of the whole GPU and how they interact.
##### Planned
We hope to design and create a Verilog of some aspects of the GPU, most notably of the hardware that handles vector operations within a GPU that can handle SIMD instructions.
##### Stretch
As a stretch goal, we may try to design and implement a simplified version of an entire GPU in Verilog.
