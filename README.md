# Computer Architecture Final Project: GPU Design and Research
### By Daniel Connolly and Qingmu "Josh" Deng

## Proposal
### Project Overview
In our final project for our computer architecture course, we intend to design and implement in Verilog some of the circuitry that handles vector operations within the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) of a computer and to explore, on a more broad scale, the architecture of GPUs. We hope this will lead us to a deeper understanding of the component and how it interacts with other elements of computers.

### Process
In order to develop an understanding of graphics processing units, we will investigate the following resources:
- [How a GPU Works from CMU](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15462-f11/www/lec_slides/lec19.pdf)
- [Nvidia Geforce 200 Architecture](https://www.nvidia.com/docs/IO/55506/GeForce_GTX_200_GPU_Technical_Brief.pdf)
- [Data-Level Parallelism in Vector, SIMD, and GPU Architectures](https://app.knovel.com/web/view/khtml/show.v/rcid:kpCAAQAE11/cid:kt00B7Z297/viewerType:khtml//root_slug:41-introduction/url_slug:data-level-introduction?b-toc-cid=kpCAAQAE11&b-toc-root-slug=&b-toc-url-slug=data-level-introduction&b-toc-title=Computer%20Architecture%20-%20A%20Quantitative%20Approach%20(5th%20Edition)&page=2&view=collapsed&zoom=1)
 - [MIAOW GPGPU](https://github.com/VerticalResearchGroup/miaow/wiki/Architecture)
 - [Introduction to Graphics Processing Units](https://app.knovel.com/web/view/khtml/show.v/rcid:kpCODTHS0F/cid:kt010Y88K6/viewerType:khtml//root_slug:computer-organization/url_slug:introduction-graphics?b-q=graphics%20processing%20unit&sort_on=default&b-subscription=true&b-group-by=true&page=26&b-sort-on=default&b-content-type=all_references&b-sort-on=default&b-content-type=all_references&view=collapsed&zoom=1&q=graphics%20processing%20unit)

### Deliverables
In terms of deliverables, we will produce a report demonstrating our level of GPU architecture understanding and explaining the purpose and functionality of this architecture. Additionally, we will produce a Verilog codebase that demonstrates the process by which GPUs perform vector calculations based upon our own design, which will be further elucidated in our report.
